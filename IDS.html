								Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are extensively used in various applications, serving as a 
								vital component in environmental monitoring. They enable the tracking of crucial parameters 
								such as temperature, humidity, air quality, and pollution levels. Intrusion detection systems 
								(IDS) find wide application across corporate networks, government agencies, and critical 
								infrastructure, effectively identifying unauthorized access attempts, malware, denial-of-service 
								attacks, and other suspicious activities. Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in WSNs, aiding 
								in the identification of uncommon occurrences and atypical patterns within collected data. 
								These anomalies can indicate sensor malfunctions, equipment failures, or potential security 
								risks, all of which require immediate attention. In IDS, our proposed system enhances security 
								and network performance in WSNs by effectively identifying and detecting malicious behavior 
								of nodes. We introduce novelty in intrusion detection systems by incorporating Ant Colony 
								Optimization (ACO) in WSNs. This approach significantly enhances the security and 
								optimality of WSNs.The proposed system effectively identifies and detects malicious behavior of nodes. We 
								propose novelty in intrusion detection systems by using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) in 
								WSNs. By addressing security and routing challenges simultaneously, we are able to provide 
								data confidentiality and establish a secure wireless network. The anomaly detection plays a 
								crucial role in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) as it aids in the detection of uncommon 
								occurrences and atypical patterns within the collected data. These anomalies can signify sensor 
								malfunctions, equipment failures, or even potential security risks, all of which require 
								immediate and suitable attention. In IDS, to improve the security and enhance the performance
