            <h2>Home Page</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The Projects page is a robust, dynamic component designed with a variety of features to enhance user experience and accessibility. This responsive page leverages React, Redux, and Framer Motion to present a seamless interface that adapts well across different screen sizes. The core functionality revolves around displaying project cards, which are essentially the user's saved outputs. Each project card showcases an iframe containing the output of the user's project, making it interactive and visually engaging. The iframe height is dynamically adjusted to fit the content, ensuring a clean and uncluttered presentation.</br></br>

One of the key features of this page is the search filtering technology, which enables users to quickly find projects based on their search terms. The filtering mechanism is case-insensitive, making it easy for users to locate projects by their titles regardless of the letter case. The search functionality is tightly integrated with Redux to manage the state effectively, ensuring that the filtered results are updated in real-time as the user types in the search input.</br></br>

Each project card is thoughtfully designed to include the project title, the user's display name or email, and a profile image or initial. The profile image is enhanced with a hover effect, scaling up slightly to draw attention. This feature adds a personal touch to each project card, allowing users to easily identify their own projects or those of others. Additionally, the card includes a bookmark icon, which can be toggled to mark projects as favorites. The bookmark state is visually represented by switching between filled and outlined bookmark icons, providing a clear indication of the user's preferences.</br></br>

The page layout is flexible, using flexbox and CSS classes to ensure that the content is well-aligned and spaced, making the user interface intuitive and easy to navigate. Motion effects, provided by Framer Motion, add an extra layer of interactivity, making the elements responsive to user actions such as tapping and hovering. This creates a smooth and engaging user experience, encouraging interaction with the project cards.</br></br>

Overall, the Projects page is a comprehensive, user-friendly feature that not only displays the user's outputs in an organized manner but also incorporates essential functionalities like search filtering, dynamic content display, and personalized interaction through bookmarking and user identification. These features collectively make it a powerful tool for users to manage and showcase their projects effectively.

            <h2>Coding Page</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The Coding page is a robust and versatile coding environment designed to enhance your web development experience by allowing you to simultaneously code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This feature-rich interface is built to streamline the process of writing and testing web applications by integrating powerful tools and a user-friendly design. The page is divided into three primary sections for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, each equipped with a code editor powered by CodeMirror, which offers syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error checking. As you type your code, the editors instantly update the output section, providing real-time feedback and allowing you to see the results of your changes immediately. This real-time preview is invaluable for testing and debugging, ensuring that you can quickly iterate on your design and functionality without needing to switch between different windows or tabs.</br></br>

                One of the standout features of the Coding page is the flexible and intuitive layout, facilitated by the SplitPane component. This allows you to resize the sections both vertically and horizontally, providing a customizable workspace that adapts to your needs. Whether you prefer a larger code editor area or more space for the output preview, you can easily adjust the panes to suit your workflow. Additionally, each section is equipped with a settings menu accessible via the FaChevronDown and FcSettings icons. These menus offer convenient options, such as the ability to clear the code in any of the editors with a single click. This is particularly useful for starting fresh or removing unwanted code without manually selecting and deleting text. The clear option enhances productivity by simplifying code management and reducing clutter.</br></br>
                
                Furthermore, the Coding page includes robust integration with Firebase, enabling seamless saving and retrieval of your projects. The save option, activated by the 'Save' button, commits your current code and project details to the Firebase Firestore database. Each project is stored with a unique identifier, along with metadata such as the title and user information, ensuring that your work is securely saved and easily accessible. This feature is essential for collaborative projects or situations where you need to access your work from different devices. Additionally, the user interface incorporates user profile details and a favorite toggle option, allowing you to mark and prioritize your most important projects. The integration with Firebase also ensures that your favorite status and project details are preserved across sessions, providing a cohesive and efficient coding experience. Overall, the Coding page offers a comprehensive and flexible coding environment that caters to both beginner and advanced web developers.</br></br>
